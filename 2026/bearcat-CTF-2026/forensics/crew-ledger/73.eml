Steve,

Get to it, lad! The deck's a right mess after that engagement.

There's blood and grime everywhere, not to mention splintered wood and other =
detritus from the fight. I want the main deck scoured clean, fore to aft. Get=
 a few hands to help you, and don't stop until it shines.

We're not sailing on a butcher's block. Make it presentable.

Barnaby.
