Captain,

Bad news from the masthead, sir.

A thick fog is rolling in fast from the west. It's already obscuring the hori=
zon and it'll be upon us completely within the next half-hour, maybe less. Vi=
sibility will be next to nothing.

This will make navigation a blind man's gamble and spotting any further threa=
ts, or even friendly vessels, impossible.

Jenkins.
