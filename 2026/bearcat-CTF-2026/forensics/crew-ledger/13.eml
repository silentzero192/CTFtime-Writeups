Captain,

Ship ahoy!

Bearing E by SE, I've just caught sight of a merchantman. Looks to be a slow =
brig, heavy laden. Sails are full, but she ain't making great speed. She's ke=
eping a steady course, appears to be heading west.

Too far for a clear flag identification yet, but she's flying plenty of canva=
s. Looks like a fat prize, sir.
