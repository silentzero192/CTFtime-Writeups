Stitch,

The Jolly Roger took a bit of a beating in that last storm. Got a couple of s=
ignificant rips, and the edges are fraying.

The Captain wants it flying proud and strong, especially with a bounty on his=
 head. Can you get to it soon? It's important for morale, and for letting the=
 world know who we are.

Let me know if you need any extra canvas or thread from the stores.

Barnaby.
