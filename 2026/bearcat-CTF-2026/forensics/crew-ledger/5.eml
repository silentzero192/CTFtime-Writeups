Listen up, you mangy lot!

It's come to my attention that some of you have been looking a bit pale, and =
your gums... well, let's just say they're not looking as healthy as a fresh c=
atch.

To avoid any widespread unpleasantness =E2=80=93 and believe me, you do *not*=
 want to experience the full delights of advanced scurvy =E2=80=93 I am insti=
tuting a mandatory scurvy check for *all* crew members.

Report to the sickbay, or my usual makeshift clinic on the main deck if the w=
eather holds, immediately after the midday meal, starting with the quarterdec=
k officers and working down. I'll call you by watch.

This is not a suggestion. This is an order. Anyone failing to report will be =
personally escorted by the bosun, and I assure you, my examination will be fa=
r less gentle. We'll get to the bottom of this, one way or another. Bring you=
r mouths, bring your limbs, and if you've been hiding any suspicious spots, n=
ow's the time to confess.

Consider this for your own good, and the good of the ship.

Dr. Alistair Pox
Ship's Surgeon
