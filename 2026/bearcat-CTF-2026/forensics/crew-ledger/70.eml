Silas,

I need your ears, and your discretion, on something that's been nagging at me.

Lately, the Captain's been... different. More secretive than usual, even for =
him. There are decisions being made, and information being withheld, that fee=
l like more than just strategic silence. The sudden shift to Tortuga, the can=
cellation of shore leave, and then the insistence on fighting that Man-o'-War=
 against all sane advice =E2=80=93 it all feels like there's a larger game af=
oot, one we're not fully privy to.

And then there's that 'Admin' character, and the password reset... it just ad=
ds to the feeling that things aren't as straightforward as they seem.

Have you noticed anything? Any strange movements, unusual orders, or an odd g=
lint in his eye that suggests he's playing his own hand? I trust your instinc=
ts for sniffing out trouble.

Anne.
