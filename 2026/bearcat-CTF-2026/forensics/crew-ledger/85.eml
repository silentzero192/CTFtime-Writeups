Thomas,

Report to the sickbay immediately.

My earlier concerns about your recent injury, specifically the laceration to =
your hand (or, perhaps, the turtle bite if it was not properly cleaned), appe=
ar to be well-founded. I've noted visible signs of infection developing, whic=
h, if left untreated, could lead to far more severe complications.

Do not delay. Bring yourself to me now.

Dr. Alistair Pox
Ship's Surgeon
