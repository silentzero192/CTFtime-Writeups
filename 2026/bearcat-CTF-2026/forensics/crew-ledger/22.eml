Pete,

I've had enough. I caught you fiddling with the fuse stock *again* yesterday,=
 and that's the third time this week. Those aren't toys for your amusement, t=
hey're vital to the cannons.

If you damage them, or worse, if you mess with the lengths and timings, you'l=
l be putting everyone's lives at risk when we're in a fight. Not to mention, =
you'll be on the receiving end of my wrath, and it'll be far worse than anyth=
ing the Captain might dish out.

Keep your grubby hands off the fuses unless you've been expressly told to han=
dle them by me or the Quartermaster. Is that clear?

Hands.
