Ahoy, Crew,

It has come to my attention that some of you have received emails with the su=
bject line 'Free Rum' or similar promises of untold grog. Let me be clear: th=
is is a trick!

**DO NOT CLICK ON ANY LINKS IN THESE EMAILS!**

These messages are not from me, nor are they from any legitimate source on bo=
ard. Clicking the link will not get you free rum, but it will likely infect y=
our devices with digital scurvy and compromise our systems.

If you receive an email like this, delete it immediately. If you have already=
 clicked on such a link, report it to me at once.

Stay vigilant, and remember, there's no such thing as a free barrel of rum in=
 your inbox.
