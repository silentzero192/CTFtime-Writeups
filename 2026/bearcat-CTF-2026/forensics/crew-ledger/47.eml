Maggie,

Given the recent storm and the unexpected change in course, I'd appreciate a =
precise fix on our current position.

The Captain's orders for Tortuga were clear, but I want to ensure we're on tr=
ack, especially with the 'peculiar patterns' you mentioned. Could you confirm=
 our coordinates?

Anne.
