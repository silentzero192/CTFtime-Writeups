Captain,

Regarding your query about the forgotten encryption password for your VeraCry=
pt volume:

I cannot directly recover or reset the password for an encrypted volume. By i=
ts very design, VeraCrypt is built to prevent such recovery to ensure maximum=
 security. If the password is lost, the data within the container is, unfortu=
nately, irrecoverable.

However, I can offer a hint based on some information you provided during the=
 initial setup phrase:

Consider the name of your very first ship.

I hope this jogs your memory.
