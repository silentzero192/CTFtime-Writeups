Pete,

Heard you were lookin' for somethin' sharp, and you know I've always got a fe=
w extra bits of steel lying about.

I'm lendin' you one of my spare daggers. It's a good piece, kept it keen. Don=
't go losin' it, and don't go sticking it where it ain't meant to be stuck. U=
se it for cuttin' rope or openin' barrels, not for pickin' fights you can't w=
in.

Give it back when you're done with it, and keep it sharp.

Thomas.
