Captain,

Land ho!

Just as you predicted, sir, a faint outline has appeared on the horizon. Bear=
ing dead ahead, slightly to starboard.

It matches the contours I've charted for our destination perfectly. The curre=
nts are with us, and the winds are holding steady. We'll be making for shore =
soon.

Maggie.
