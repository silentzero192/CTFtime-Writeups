Anne,

Nonsense. Flee? After a bounty's been placed on my head, and with a fat Briti=
sh pig daring to cross our path? Never.

This ship, and this crew, fights. We've faced worse, and we've emerged victor=
ious, richer for the trouble. A show of cowardice now would shatter the crew'=
s spirit and paint a target on our backs for every petty patrol.

Ready the boarding parties. I want grappling hooks primed, and cutlasses shar=
pened. We'll show them what the *Scallywag* is made of.

We fight.

Captain "Black" Hook
