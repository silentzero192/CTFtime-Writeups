Captain,

With all due respect, and given the state of our powder, the recent damage to=
 the main sail, and the general unrest amongst the crew, I strongly advise ag=
ainst engaging that British Man-o'-War.

We're outmatched in firepower and potentially in numbers. A direct confrontat=
ion right now would be a gamble we are ill-equipped to win. Our best course o=
f action is to use our superior maneuverability and the cover of the approach=
ing evening to outrun them.

There's no glory in a lost ship and a dead crew, Captain. Let's live to plund=
er another day.

Anne.
