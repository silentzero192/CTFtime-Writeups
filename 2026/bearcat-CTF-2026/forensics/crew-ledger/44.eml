Captain,

I must report that Quartermaster Silas Vane has presented with a significant =
fever and is complaining of severe chills and body aches. His condition is co=
ncerning, and I've ordered him to sickbay for observation and treatment.

I've administered what remedies I have on hand, but he is currently confined =
and unable to perform his duties effectively. I will, of course, monitor him =
closely and provide further updates as his condition develops.

For the time being, you should consider the Quartermaster indisposed.

Dr. Alistair Pox
Ship's Surgeon
