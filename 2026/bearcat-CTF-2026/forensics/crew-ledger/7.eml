Silas,

A whisper has reached my ears, and it's not the usual grumbling about grog or=
 the cook's gruel. There's talk circulating amongst some of the crew, murmeri=
ngs about discontent that are starting to sound a touch more serious than sim=
ple complaints.

I've heard mentions of "better prospects" and "unfit leadership," though noth=
ing concrete enough to pin down. It's subtle, but persistent, and has that pa=
rticular scent of trouble.

Have you noticed anything amiss in your dealings with the crew, perhaps aroun=
d the ration lines or during your rounds? I trust your ear for the ship's pul=
se. We can't afford any cracks in our unity, not with this voyage just begun.

Let's keep our eyes open.

Anne Bonny
First Mate
