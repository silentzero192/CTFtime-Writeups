Steve,

Me eye patch is gone. Vanished right off me bunk.

And seeing as you were the only other scallywag rooting around in our quarter=
s this morning, I reckon you might know something about its sudden disappeara=
nce.

Don't go playing the innocent deckhand with me. I know your tricks, and you k=
now mine. Hand it over, and we'll say no more about it. Keep it, and we'll ha=
ve words, and maybe a search of your hammock.

Thomas
