Silas,

A quick question for you regarding these system-wide emails we've been receiv=
ing, particularly the recent "phishing alert" from 'Admin'.

Who exactly is this 'Admin'? I don't recall anyone officially being assigned =
that role, nor have I seen a new face among the crew that fits the descriptio=
n. Is this some new hire the Captain brought on without consulting anyone? Or=
 perhaps it's one of our own taking on new duties?

It's important to know who's got access to our ship-mail and sending out dire=
ctives to the entire crew, especially when they're talking about 'digital scu=
rvy'. Transparency, Silas.

Let me know what you know.

Anne.
