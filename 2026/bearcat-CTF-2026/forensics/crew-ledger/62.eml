Barnaby,

Report from the sickbay. We have three men wounded in the recent engagement.

Two of them are serious, requiring immediate and ongoing attention. The third=
 is a lesser injury, but still requires rest. I've got them stabilized for no=
w, but they'll be out of commission for a while.

I'll need some assistance in the sickbay if we're to keep them comfortable an=
d tend to their needs, especially if their watches were due. Assign some reli=
able, light-handed lads if you can spare them.

Pox.
