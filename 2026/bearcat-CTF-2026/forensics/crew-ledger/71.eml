Anne,

Your concerns have not fallen on deaf ears. In fact, they echo some of my own=
 observations.

This isn't a conversation for ship-mail, nor for the open deck. There's too m=
uch at stake, and too many walls with ears.

Meet me in the deepest part of the main hold, near the old water casks, at mi=
dnight tonight. Come alone, and ensure no one sees you.

We need to talk, discreetly.

Silas.
