Ahoy, me stalwart crew!

Hear ye, hear ye! The winds of fortune whisper in our ears, and the charts =
=E2=80=93 oh, the glorious charts! =E2=80=93 they sing a song of unimaginable=
 riches!

Our long, hard voyage, the battles fought, the storms weathered, the sacrific=
es made... it was all for this moment! The X is no longer a distant dream, bu=
t a tangible promise, almost within our grasp. I feel it in my bones, and the=
 very sea tells me so.

Prepare yourselves, me hearties! Sharpen your senses, ready your shovels, and=
 keep your hopes high! We are on the verge of claiming the greatest prize a p=
irate crew could ever dream of! Glory, gold, and immortality await!

Captain "Black" Hook
