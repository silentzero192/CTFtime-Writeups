Silas,

We've got a growing problem in the pantry. The rats, they're bolder than ever=
, and their numbers seem to be multiplyin' faster than a bosun's curses.

They're gnawing through sacks, leaving droppings everywhere, and I've even se=
en 'em scurryin' across the flour barrels in broad daylight. This ain't just =
an annoyance; it's a threat to our provisions, especially after that last sal=
t pork incident.

I need traps, rat poison, a cat =E2=80=93 anything you can get your hands on =
to cull their numbers before they eat us out of house and home. This can't wa=
it.
