Barnaby,

Thomas is in my quarters again, requiring my attention for another superficia=
l but nonetheless irritating laceration to his hand. This makes the third suc=
h incident this week, each one preventable if the man would simply pay more h=
eed to his surroundings =E2=80=93 or perhaps exercise a modicum of caution wi=
th his "thieving."

He's patched up now, but I've warned him that my supply of clean bandages and=
 even my patience are not infinite. Perhaps a reminder from the Boatswain reg=
arding proper tool handling, or indeed, the handling of anything sharp on thi=
s vessel, might prevent another visit.

Just thought you should know.

Pox.
