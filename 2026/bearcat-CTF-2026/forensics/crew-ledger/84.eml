Anne,

Your worries... they've been rattling in my own head too. More than you know.

Just this morning, I caught him in his cabin, not looking at charts, not mutt=
ering to himself as usual. He was... talking. Conversing, almost. To a bloody=
 parrot. And not just any parrot, a new one I've never seen before, small and=
 dark. He kept calling it 'Root'.

He was asking it for advice, mind you! About secrets and forgotten words. It =
stared back at him with one eye, squawking gibberish, and he nodded like it w=
as making perfect sense.

I don't know what to make of it, Anne. It's definitely not like him. The pecu=
liar patterns in the sky might be easier to understand than this.

Maggie.
