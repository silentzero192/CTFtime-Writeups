Subject: Storm incoming!

Ahoy, everyone!

Listen up! I've been watchin' the horizon, and there's a proper beast of a storm headin' our way. Skies are turnin' dark faster than a stolen coin, and the wind's starting to howl somethin' fierce from the north-west.

Looks like it'll be on us within the hour, maybe sooner. Brace yourselves and secure everything on deck!

Jenkins.
