Subject: Inspection tomorrow

Listen up, you lot!

I've just been informed that the Captain will be conducting a full ship inspection tomorrow morning, first thing after the morning watch.

I expect every man and woman to have their quarters in order, personal gear stowed, and their stations shipshape and Bristol fashion. Any sloppiness or dereliction of duty will be noted, and believe me, you do *not* want to be on the Captain's bad side during an inspection.

Clean your weapons, scrub your decks, and make sure everything is exactly where it should be. We've just fought a battle, but that's no excuse for lax standards. Get to it!

Barnaby "The Blade" Thorne
Boatswain
