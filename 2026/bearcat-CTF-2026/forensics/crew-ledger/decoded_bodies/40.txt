Subject: We need more cannonballs

Captain,

A matter of urgency regarding our combat readiness.

Following our recent skirmishes and considering the targets ahead, our stores of cannonballs are critically depleted. We simply do not have enough shot to sustain a prolonged engagement, or even a proper defense, should we encounter a well-armed opponent.

My lads are ready, but without sufficient iron to load, our cannons are little more than expensive ornaments. This needs immediate attention, sir. We cannot afford to be caught unawares with empty magazines.
