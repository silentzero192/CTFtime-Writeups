Subject: I thought YOU had the key

Silas,

With all due respect, when did I become the sole keeper of the main treasure chest key?

Last I checked, the primary key for the main chest was always with the Quartermaster. After I reported the *crates* missing, I assumed you would have taken extra precautions or, at the very least, would have been the one to secure the primary chest.

My duties are inventory and logistics, not standing guard over every last coin, especially when the main key wasn't in my possession.

I'm as shocked as you are, perhaps more so given the earlier discovery of that *other* key. This is a far bigger problem than simple misplacement.

Silver.
