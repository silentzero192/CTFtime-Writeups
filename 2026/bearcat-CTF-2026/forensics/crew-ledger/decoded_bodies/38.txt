Subject: Shore Leave Canceled

Listen up, you scurvy dogs!

Due to unforeseen circumstances and pressing matters of the voyage, all shore leave in Tortuga is hereby *canceled*.

I know some of ye were looking forward to a bit of land-based carousing, but our objectives have shifted, and the ship demands our full attention. We have business to attend to that takes precedence over taverns and doxies.

Any man or woman caught attempting to desert, or found ashore without express orders from myself or the First Mate, will face the harshest consequences.

Consider yourselves warned. Your duty is to this ship, and to me.

Captain "Black" Hook
