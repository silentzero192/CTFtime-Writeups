Subject: Sail is riddled with holes

Hands,

Just finished assessing the main sail after the scuffle.

It's not just a tear anymore, lad. It's riddled with holes, big and small, from that British cannon fire. It looks like a moth-eaten shroud, not a sail fit for the *Scallywag*.

I can patch it, aye, but it's going to take every scrap of good canvas we have left and a hell of a lot of work. We'll be slow going until it's properly mended, or until we can get new canvas.

Just thought you should know the extent of it.

Stitch.
