Subject: Best escape route if needed

Captain,

While your resolve to fight is understood, it is prudent to always have a fallback.

I've plotted a rapid disengagement route, should the need arise. It utilizes a series of shallow reefs and a narrow channel known only to a few, which a ship of their draft would struggle to navigate. If we can get through the initial engagement and make for this specific area, we could lose them.

The attached `escape.png` highlights the proposed vector. It's tight sailing, but our ship, under skilled hands, could manage it.

Maggie.
