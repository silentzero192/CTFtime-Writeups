Silas,

A whisper has reached my ears, and it's not the usual grumbling about grog or the cook's gruel. There's talk circulating amongst some of the crew, murmerings about discontent that are starting to sound a touch more serious than simple complaints.

I've heard mentions of "better prospects" and "unfit leadership," though nothing concrete enough to pin down. It's subtle, but persistent, and has that particular scent of trouble.

Have you noticed anything amiss in your dealings with the crew, perhaps around the ration lines or during your rounds? I trust your ear for the ship's pulse. We can't afford any cracks in our unity, not with this voyage just begun.

Let's keep our eyes open.

Anne Bonny
