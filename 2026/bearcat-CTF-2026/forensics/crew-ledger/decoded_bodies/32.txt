Subject: Instructions for VeraCrypt

Captain,

Following your inquiry regarding folder encryption, I've prepared a brief guide.

I recommend using VeraCrypt for this purpose. It is a robust and widely-used tool that will allow you to create an encrypted container or encrypt an entire partition, ensuring your documents remain secure.

I've attached a concise manual (`manual.txt`) that outlines the basic steps for setting up and using VeraCrypt to encrypt a folder or create a secure container. It covers installation, creating a new volume, and mounting/dismounting it.

Please review the instructions carefully. If you encounter any difficulties or require further assistance, do not hesitate to contact me.
