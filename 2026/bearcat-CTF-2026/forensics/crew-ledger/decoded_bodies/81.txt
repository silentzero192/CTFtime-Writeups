Subject: I forgot my encryption password

Admin,

Blast and damnation! That cursed encryption password for my private files, it's gone right out of my head like a puff of smoke.

My memory's a treasure chest full of important things, but this one key has slipped from my grasp. I followed your instructions to the letter, but now I can't for the life of me recall the exact string of gibberish I used.

Is there a way to recover it, or perhaps reset access to that encrypted folder? This is a matter of considerable urgency.

Captain.
