Subject: The treasure is near

Ahoy, me stalwart crew!

Hear ye, hear ye! The winds of fortune whisper in our ears, and the charts – oh, the glorious charts! – they sing a song of unimaginable riches!

Our long, hard voyage, the battles fought, the storms weathered, the sacrifices made... it was all for this moment! The X is no longer a distant dream, but a tangible promise, almost within our grasp. I feel it in my bones, and the very sea tells me so.

Prepare yourselves, me hearties! Sharpen your senses, ready your shovels, and keep your hopes high! We are on the verge of claiming the greatest prize a pirate crew could ever dream of! Glory, gold, and immortality await!

Captain "Black" Hook
