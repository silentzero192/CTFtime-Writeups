Subject: Where exactly are we?

Maggie,

Given the recent storm and the unexpected change in course, I'd appreciate a precise fix on our current position.

The Captain's orders for Tortuga were clear, but I want to ensure we're on track, especially with the 'peculiar patterns' you mentioned. Could you confirm our coordinates?

Anne.
