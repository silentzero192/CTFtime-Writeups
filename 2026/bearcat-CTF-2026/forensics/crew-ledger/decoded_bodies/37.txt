Subject: Who is 'Admin'?

Silas,

A quick question for you regarding these system-wide emails we've been receiving, particularly the recent "phishing alert" from 'Admin'.

Who exactly is this 'Admin'? I don't recall anyone officially being assigned that role, nor have I seen a new face among the crew that fits the description. Is this some new hire the Captain brought on without consulting anyone? Or perhaps it's one of our own taking on new duties?

It's important to know who's got access to our ship-mail and sending out directives to the entire crew, especially when they're talking about 'digital scurvy'. Transparency, Silas.

Let me know what you know.

Anne.
