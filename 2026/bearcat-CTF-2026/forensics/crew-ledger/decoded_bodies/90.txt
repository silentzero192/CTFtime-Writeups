Captain,

Following your request for secure remote access capabilities, I have enabled SSH (Secure Shell) access on your designated shipboard terminal.

This will allow you to establish encrypted connections to remote systems, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of your communications.

Attached is your public SSH key, `id_rsa.pub`. You will need to add this key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on any server or device you wish to access securely via SSH. This will enable passwordless, authenticated access.

Please handle this key with appropriate care. If you require further assistance with its configuration or use, do not hesitate to contact me.
