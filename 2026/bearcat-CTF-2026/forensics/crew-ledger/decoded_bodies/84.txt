Subject: He's talking to a parrot named 'Root'

Anne,

Your worries... they've been rattling in my own head too. More than you know.

Just this morning, I caught him in his cabin, not looking at charts, not muttering to himself as usual. He was... talking. Conversing, almost. To a bloody parrot. And not just any parrot, a new one I've never seen before, small and dark. He kept calling it 'Root'.

He was asking it for advice, mind you! About secrets and forgotten words. It stared back at him with one eye, squawking gibberish, and he nodded like it was making perfect sense.

I don't know what to make of it, Anne. It's definitely not like him. The peculiar patterns in the sky might be easier to understand than this.

Maggie.
