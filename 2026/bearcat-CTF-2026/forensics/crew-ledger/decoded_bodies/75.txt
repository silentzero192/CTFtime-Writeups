Subject: Want to buy a stolen watch?

Pete,

Got something special here, fell off a certain British officer's wrist during the boarding.

It's a proper fancy pocket watch, solid silver, keeps time like a charm. Real valuable, this. I reckon it's worth a small fortune.

I've attached a picture (`watch.jpg`). Interested in owning a piece of the action? I'll give you a good price, just for you.

Thomas.
