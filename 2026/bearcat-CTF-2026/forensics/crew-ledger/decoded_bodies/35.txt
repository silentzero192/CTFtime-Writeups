Subject: Audit of the treasure chest

Silver,

Further to your report regarding the missing crates of gold, I have conducted an immediate audit of the main treasure chest and the surrounding storage areas.

The attached `audit_report.xlsx` details my findings, including inventory discrepancies beyond the gold, a review of recent access logs, and an assessment of the security protocols in place.

We need to discuss this as a matter of urgency. Be prepared to go over the report in detail and account for these variances.

Silas.
