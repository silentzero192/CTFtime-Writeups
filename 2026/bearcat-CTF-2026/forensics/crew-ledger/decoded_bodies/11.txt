Anne,

A matter of utmost discretion, this. My eyes only for you, understand?

The whispers of the sea have led me to something... significant. A legend, perhaps, but one with the scent of truth. I've been holding onto this for the opportune moment, and I believe that moment is now.

Attached ye'll find a sealed file, `secret_location.zip`. It contains a fragment of an old chart, one that points to more than just a typical prize. This isn't just about gold; it's about something that could change our fortunes entirely, and perhaps the course of history for the *Scallywag*.

Open it when you are alone, and commit its contents to memory. Destroy the file once you've absorbed the details. I want your unvarnished assessment of its feasibility, and a plan for how we might approach it without rousing suspicion among the crew. This must remain between us for the time being.

Come to my cabin after the midnight watch. We will discuss the 'X'.

Captain "Black" Hook
