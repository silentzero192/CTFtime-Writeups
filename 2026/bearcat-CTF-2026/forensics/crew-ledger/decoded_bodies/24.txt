Pox,

My latest inventory shows our supply of lime juice is running dangerously low. With the crew's health in mind, and the usual complaints of tooth-wobbling and joint-aching starting up again, we need to restock, and fast.

You know as well as I do what happens when the preventative measures slacken. Let me know your estimated quantity needed and any specifics on quality you require. I'll arrange for its acquisition at the earliest opportunity in Tortuga, or wherever our next port o' call may be.

Don't let the men get scurvy on my watch.

Silas.
