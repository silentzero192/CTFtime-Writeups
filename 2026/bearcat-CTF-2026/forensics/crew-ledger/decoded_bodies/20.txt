Subject: Missing crates of gold

Silas,

I've just completed the latest inventory check of the hold, and I've got a pressing matter to report. The three crates of gold, the ones we secured after the last run on the *Empress's Gambit*, appear to be missing.

I've double-checked my logs, the manifest, and scoured their usual spot. They are nowhere to be found. The last time I personally laid eyes on them was three days ago during the last full inspection. There are no signs of forced entry, but they certainly aren't where they should be.

This isn't a simple case of misplacement. I think we have a serious problem on our hands.

Silver.
