Subject: Bounty on my head

Ahoy, me hearties!

It seems I've once again earned the affections of certain landlubber authorities. Word's reached me that some stiff-necked governor or another has seen fit to put a price on my head.

I've attached a copy of their pitiful attempt at a wanted poster for your amusement. See that mug? That's the face of a man who knows how to find gold, and how to keep it.

Let this be a reminder to you all: The richer they think *I* am, the richer *we* all become. Every navy ship, every patrol, every greedy dog out there looking for a reward... they're just more targets, more opportunity. They want my head? They'll have to come and take it! And they'll find a crew ready to send 'em to Davy Jones' Locker for daring to try.

This only means we're doing something right! Keep your spirits high and your cutlasses sharp. There's glory and plunder to be had for those who stand with Black Hook!

Captain "Black" Hook
