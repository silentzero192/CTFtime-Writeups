Subject: Stars are hidden tonight

Silas,

Just a heads-up from the crow's nest. The sky's as thick as pea soup tonight, not a single star to be seen. Clouds are heavy and low, and the moon's playing hide-and-seek.

It's making proper celestial navigation impossible. We're relying on dead reckoning and the compass for now, but it means I can't get a precise fix on our position. Keeps us on course, aye, but without the usual certainty.

Just wanted you to be aware.

Maggie.
