Subject: Lending you my spare dagger

Pete,

Heard you were lookin' for somethin' sharp, and you know I've always got a few extra bits of steel lying about.

I'm lendin' you one of my spare daggers. It's a good piece, kept it keen. Don't go losin' it, and don't go sticking it where it ain't meant to be stuck. Use it for cuttin' rope or openin' barrels, not for pickin' fights you can't win.

Give it back when you're done with it, and keep it sharp.

Thomas.
