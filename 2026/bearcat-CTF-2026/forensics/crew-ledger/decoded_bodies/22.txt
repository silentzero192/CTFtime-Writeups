Subject: Stop playing with the fuses!

Pete,

I've had enough. I caught you fiddling with the fuse stock *again* yesterday, and that's the third time this week. Those aren't toys for your amusement, they're vital to the cannons.

If you damage them, or worse, if you mess with the lengths and timings, you'll be putting everyone's lives at risk when we're in a fight. Not to mention, you'll be on the receiving end of my wrath, and it'll be far worse than anything the Captain might dish out.

Keep your grubby hands off the fuses unless you've been expressly told to handle them by me or the Quartermaster. Is that clear?

Hands.
