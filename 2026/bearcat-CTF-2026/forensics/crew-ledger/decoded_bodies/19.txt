Subject: Found your eye patch in the bilge

Thomas,

I was down in the bilge, clearin' out some o' the usual muck, and wouldn't ye know it, found this.

Looks mighty like that patch o' yours. Don't ask me how it got down there with the rats and the runoff, but there it was. Took a quick picture, see the attachment.

Come fetch it whenever you're not busy 'misplacin'' other things.

Steve
