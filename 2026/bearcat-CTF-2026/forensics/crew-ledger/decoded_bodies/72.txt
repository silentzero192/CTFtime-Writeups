Subject: My leg is acting up again

Pox,

My accursed leg is acting up again. The old wound, you know the one. That last broadside we took didn't help, jostled it something fierce.

It's giving me a real bite tonight, throbbing like a drum. I need something to take the edge off, or at least to let me get some damn sleep before the next watch.

Send up whatever potion or poultice you deem fit. And make it quick.

Captain.
