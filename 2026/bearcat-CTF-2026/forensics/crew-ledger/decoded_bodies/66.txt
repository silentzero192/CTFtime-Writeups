Subject: VICTORY! Extra grog for all

Ahoy, me valiant Scallywags!

By the beard of Neptune, we did it! That British warship thought it could stand against the *Scallywag*? They learned their lesson, sinking faster than a grogless sailor!

You fought like true devils, every last one of ye! From the lookout spotting the bastard, to the gunners blowing holes in her hull, to the deckhands swarming her like a plague of locusts! We showed them the true meaning of piracy!

To celebrate this glorious victory, and to mend those weary bones and spirits, I declare **extra grog for all, starting immediately!** Quartermaster, see to it that every man and woman gets their fill tonight.

Raise a cup to our courage, to our cunning, and to the endless possibilities that await us! Tonight, we drink! Tomorrow, we set sail for richer prizes!

Captain "Black" Hook
