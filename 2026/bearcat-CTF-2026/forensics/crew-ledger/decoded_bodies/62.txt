Subject: We have three wounded

Barnaby,

Report from the sickbay. We have three men wounded in the recent engagement.

Two of them are serious, requiring immediate and ongoing attention. The third is a lesser injury, but still requires rest. I've got them stabilized for now, but they'll be out of commission for a while.

I'll need some assistance in the sickbay if we're to keep them comfortable and tend to their needs, especially if their watches were due. Assign some reliable, light-handed lads if you can spare them.

Pox.
