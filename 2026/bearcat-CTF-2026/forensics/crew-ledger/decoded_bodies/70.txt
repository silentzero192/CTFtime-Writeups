Subject: I think the Captain is hiding something

Silas,

I need your ears, and your discretion, on something that's been nagging at me.

Lately, the Captain's been... different. More secretive than usual, even for him. There are decisions being made, and information being withheld, that feel like more than just strategic silence. The sudden shift to Tortuga, the cancellation of shore leave, and then the insistence on fighting that Man-o'-War against all sane advice – it all feels like there's a larger game afoot, one we're not fully privy to.

And then there's that 'Admin' character, and the password reset... it just adds to the feeling that things aren't as straightforward as they seem.

Have you noticed anything? Any strange movements, unusual orders, or an odd glint in his eye that suggests he's playing his own hand? I trust your instincts for sniffing out trouble.

Anne.
