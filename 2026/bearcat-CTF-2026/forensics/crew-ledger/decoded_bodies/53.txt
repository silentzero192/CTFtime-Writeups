Subject: Wash your hands!

Listen up, you unwashed masses!

It seems I must reiterate a crucial directive, one that some of you appear to be treating with utter disregard: **Wash. Your. Hands!**

After handling ropes, after visiting the privy, before you even *think* about touching your rations – scrub those paws! We're living in close quarters, and one man's filth quickly becomes everyone's affliction. I'm seeing far too many grubby digits, and that's a direct route to sickness spreading throughout the ship like wildfire.

I have limited supplies for treating widespread illness. Do your part to prevent it. Soap and water are available. Use them. Consider this your final gentle reminder before I start conducting surprise inspections.

Your health, and indeed the health of the entire crew, depends on it.

Dr. Alistair Pox
Ship's Surgeon
