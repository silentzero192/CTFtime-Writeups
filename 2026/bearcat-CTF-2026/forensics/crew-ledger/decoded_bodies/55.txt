Alright, you mangy dogs!

Jenkins has spotted a British warship on the horizon, and she's closing fast! This isn't a drill, this is the real deal!

**ACTION STATIONS!** Every man and woman to their posts! Gunners, prepare the cannons! Boatswain, ready the rigging for swift maneuvers! First Mate, keep an eye on those gunwales!

Sharpen your cutlasses, load your pistols, and prepare for battle! We'll show those redcoats what happens when they cross the *Scallywag*! No quarter given, no quarter asked!

For glory! For plunder! For freedom!

Captain "Black" Hook
