Subject: Charting the Caribbean

Captain,

The Caribbean's a tricky mistress, but I've wrestled with her charts and she's starting to reveal her secrets.

I've sketched out a preliminary route, marked with what I believe to be the most advantageous currents and, more importantly, the least patrolled waters. There's a particular stretch near the Serpent's Tooth shoals that could shave days off our journey, provided we navigate it in the right moon cycle. Risky, perhaps, but high reward for those with the guts to follow.

I've attached `route_v1.png` for your perusal. The red line is my primary recommendation, the dashed blue a slightly safer, albeit slower, alternative. I've also highlighted a few potential stopping points for fresh water or, dare I say, fresh targets.

My head's already buzzing with wind direction and star alignments. Let me know your thoughts on this initial sweep, Captain. The sea whispers to me, and I'm listening.
