Subject: Nonsense we fight

Anne,

Nonsense. Flee? After a bounty's been placed on my head, and with a fat British pig daring to cross our path? Never.

This ship, and this crew, fights. We've faced worse, and we've emerged victorious, richer for the trouble. A show of cowardice now would shatter the crew's spirit and paint a target on our backs for every petty patrol.

Ready the boarding parties. I want grappling hooks primed, and cutlasses sharpened. We'll show them what the *Scallywag* is made of.

We fight.

Captain "Black" Hook
