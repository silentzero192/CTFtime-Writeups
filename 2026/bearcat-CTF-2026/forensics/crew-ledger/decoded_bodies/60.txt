Subject: Backup your mailboxes

Ahoy, Crew,

A critical reminder regarding data preservation on the *Scallywag.net* network.

While our systems are robust, wise sailors always secure their valuables. I strongly advise all crew members to back up their ship-mail mailboxes regularly. This ensures that your valuable communications, records, and any... *sensitive* information remain safe, even in the event of unforeseen system anomalies or digital squalls.

I've attached a simple backup script, `backup_script.sh`, to assist you in this process. Please execute it on your primary shipboard device. Detailed instructions for its use are included within the script itself.

Should you encounter any difficulties or require assistance in securing your mail, do not hesitate to contact the System Administrator.
