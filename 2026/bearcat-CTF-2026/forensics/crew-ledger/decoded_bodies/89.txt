Subject: They exploded early

Mr. Hands,

Sir! The new shells! The ones you just made!

They... they exploded. Not all of them, just a few, but they went off early. In the magazine. Not a big explosion, but it was loud! And smoke!

I think they went off when I was just moving them to the hoist. I didn't even drop them this time!

I'm sorry, sir!

Pete.
