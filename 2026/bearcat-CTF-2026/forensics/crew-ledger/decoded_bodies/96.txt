Subject: I need a sleeping draught

Pox,

My accursed leg is flaring up something terrible again, and the excitement of the impending treasure isn't helping me rest. My mind races like a gale-force wind.

I need a strong sleeping draught, one that will knock me out cold for a good, long stretch. No weak tea, no mild poultices. Something that will ensure I get proper, undisturbed sleep tonight.

Send it to my cabin. And make it potent.

Captain.
