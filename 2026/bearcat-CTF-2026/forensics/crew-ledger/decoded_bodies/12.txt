Subject: Did you steal my eye patch?

Steve,

Me eye patch is gone. Vanished right off me bunk.

And seeing as you were the only other scallywag rooting around in our quarters this morning, I reckon you might know something about its sudden disappearance.

Don't go playing the innocent deckhand with me. I know your tricks, and you know mine. Hand it over, and we'll say no more about it. Keep it, and we'll have words, and maybe a search of your hammock.

Thomas
