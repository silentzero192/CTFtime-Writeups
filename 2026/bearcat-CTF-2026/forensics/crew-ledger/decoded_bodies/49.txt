Subject: Hidden compartment found

Captain,

During a thorough re-inspection of the hold, specifically around the area where the crates of gold were last accounted for, I made an unexpected discovery. There appears to be a hidden compartment.

It's cunningly concealed, built into one of the older bulkheads, and not visible during routine checks. I believe the strange key Silver found might be related to its mechanism, though I haven't attempted to force it open without your direct order.

I've sketched a rough schematic, attached as `schematic.pdf`, showing its approximate location and dimensions based on what I could discern.

This could explain the missing gold, or it could be something entirely different. I await your instructions on how to proceed.
