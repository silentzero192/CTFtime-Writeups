Subject: The Quartermaster has a fever

Captain,

I must report that Quartermaster Silas Vane has presented with a significant fever and is complaining of severe chills and body aches. His condition is concerning, and I've ordered him to sickbay for observation and treatment.

I've administered what remedies I have on hand, but he is currently confined and unable to perform his duties effectively. I will, of course, monitor him closely and provide further updates as his condition develops.

For the time being, you should consider the Quartermaster indisposed.

Dr. Alistair Pox
