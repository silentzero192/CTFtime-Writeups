Subject: Server maintenance at midnight

Silas,

Please be advised that I will be performing essential maintenance on the main server tonight, commencing at midnight.

There will be a period of downtime, estimated to last approximately two hours, during which email services and any other networked systems will be unavailable. Please ensure any critical communications are sent before then.

I expect full functionality to be restored by 0200.
