Captain,

I've been observing the crew closely these past few days, and there's a definite unease setting in amongst the men. Morale seems to be dropping faster than a lead anchor.

There's been more grumbling than usual in the mess, and a few minor squabbles have broken out on deck that went beyond typical banter. Some are restless, others just plain bored, and a few are starting to look for trouble where there isn't any.

It might be the long stretch without a proper score, or perhaps the recent course change without a clear explanation for them. Whatever it is, the tension is growing.

Just thought you should be aware.

Anne.
