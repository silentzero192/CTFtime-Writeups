Subject: Experimental shells ready

Captain,

A promising development from the powder magazine and forge, sir.

The experimental shells we discussed, the ones with the extra punch, are ready for deployment. My lads and I have been refining the composition and casing, and I believe we've found a combination that delivers a truly devastating impact.

I've attached the `test_results.pdf` detailing our recent firing trials. The destructive power is significantly improved, and the trajectory is surprisingly stable for such... *innovative* ordnance.

These could turn the tide in our next major engagement, Captain. My cannons are eager to spit them.
