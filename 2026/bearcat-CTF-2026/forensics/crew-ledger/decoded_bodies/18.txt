Subject: Main sail has a tear

Barnaby,

Just wanted to give ye a heads-up. The main sail's got a fresh tear, 'bout a fathom long near the leech. Must've caught somethin' fierce in that last squall.

It's not critical yet, but it'll need mendin' soon before it gets worse and we lose a good bit o' canvas. Let me know when's best to get a few hands to help take it down for repairs.

Stitch.
