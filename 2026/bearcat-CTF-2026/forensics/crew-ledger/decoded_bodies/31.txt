Subject: How do I encrypt a folder?

Admin,

I've got some sensitive documents I need to keep under wraps, even from prying eyes on this vessel.

Could you tell me how to properly secure a particular folder on my system? I need to make sure its contents are... well, not easily accessed by anyone without my direct say-so. Encrypting it, I believe, is the term.

Let me know the steps or if there's a particular trick to it.

Captain.
