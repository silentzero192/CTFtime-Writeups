Thomas,

Report to the sickbay immediately.

My earlier concerns about your recent injury, specifically the laceration to your hand (or, perhaps, the turtle bite if it was not properly cleaned), appear to be well-founded. I've noted visible signs of infection developing, which, if left untreated, could lead to far more severe complications.

Do not delay. Bring yourself to me now.

Dr. Alistair Pox
Ship's Surgeon
