Subject: Let's meet in the hold at midnight

Anne,

Your concerns have not fallen on deaf ears. In fact, they echo some of my own observations.

This isn't a conversation for ship-mail, nor for the open deck. There's too much at stake, and too many walls with ears.

Meet me in the deepest part of the main hold, near the old water casks, at midnight tonight. Come alone, and ensure no one sees you.

We need to talk, discreetly.

Silas.
