Subject: Weekly Grog Ration Update

Ahoy, you thirsty scallywags!

Just a quick word on the grog rations for the upcoming week. The barrels have been counted, the water's been added (don't give me that look, it's tradition!), and your shares are ready.

Ration distribution will commence tomorrow, after the morning watch, on the main deck. Make sure you're there, sober and orderly. Any complaints about the measure, take 'em up with the bosun, not me. My job's to make sure everyone gets their due, not to listen to yer whinging.

And a word of caution: there's only so much to go around. Don't be caught trying to double-dip or "borrow" from your shipmates' shares. I've got eyes everywhere, and anyone caught pilfering will find their next ration considerably drier, if they get one at all.

That is all.
