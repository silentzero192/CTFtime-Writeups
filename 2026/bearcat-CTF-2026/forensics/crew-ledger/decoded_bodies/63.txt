Subject: No dinner until the fire is out

Alright, you scurvy dogs!

Listen up! There's a fire blazing in the galley, or maybe somewhere else, but it's close enough to my pots and pans for me to give a damn.

Until that blaze is out, every last flickering ember, there'll be no dinner tonight. My kitchen's not for burning, and neither are your bellies.

So, get yer buckets, get yer axes, and get that fire doused! Only then will I even *think* about putting a meal on the table.

Groggy George.
