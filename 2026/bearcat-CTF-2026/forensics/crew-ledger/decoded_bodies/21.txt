Maggie,

Considering your recent weather observations and some other... *developments*, I've decided we need to adjust our course.

Set a new bearing for Tortuga. We'll make for the main harbor. I want to be there within the next three days, tide and wind willing. Calculate the most direct and safest route.

Come to my cabin with the charts once you've plotted the new course. I want to review it with you and discuss the potential challenges your "peculiar patterns" might present.

Captain.
