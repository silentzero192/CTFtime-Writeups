Subject: Log file analysis complete

Silas,

Per your request for an in-depth analysis of recent system activities, I have completed my review of the relevant log files.

I've identified several patterns of access and data movement that warrant immediate attention. There are unauthorized attempts to access restricted compartments of the ship's network, as well as unusual file modifications and deletions.

The attached `suspicious_activity.log` details these anomalies, including timestamps and originating user accounts where discernable. Pay particular attention to the entries regarding the treasure manifest.

This activity is not random. It suggests a deliberate and coordinated effort.
