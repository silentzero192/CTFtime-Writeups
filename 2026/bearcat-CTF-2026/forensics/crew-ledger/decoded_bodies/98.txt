Subject: Last meal on the ship before shore

Alright, you hungry landlubbers!

Listen up! This is your call for the final meal on the *Scallywag* before we make for shore!

I've put together a hearty spread, the best I could manage with what we have left. Fill your bellies, for who knows what kind of slop awaits you in those shore taverns!

Come and get it while it's hot! And don't bother asking for seconds, there ain't any.

Groggy George.
