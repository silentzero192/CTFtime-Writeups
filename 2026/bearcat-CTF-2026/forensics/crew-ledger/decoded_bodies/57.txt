Captain,

With all due respect, and given the state of our powder, the recent damage to the main sail, and the general unrest amongst the crew, I strongly advise against engaging that British Man-o'-War.

We're outmatched in firepower and potentially in numbers. A direct confrontation right now would be a gamble we are ill-equipped to win. Our best course of action is to use our superior maneuverability and the cover of the approaching evening to outrun them.

There's no glory in a lost ship and a dead crew, Captain. Let's live to plunder another day.

Anne.
