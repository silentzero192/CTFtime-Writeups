Silas,

We're running dangerously low on good, strong rope, and it's putting a strain on my lads. Between mending the rigging after that last squall, securing the longboat properly, and a few other bits and bobs around the deck, our stores are looking threadbare.

I've attached a provisional list of what we need and the estimated length required, along with an old invoice as a guide for the type and quality. We can't afford any shoddy stuff; a weak line means a lost spar or worse.

Could you see to getting this sorted at our next port of call, or perhaps make arrangements with the Captain if there's an earlier opportunity? My lads are patching what they can, but we're at the end of our tether here.

Barnaby "The Blade" Thorne
Boatswain
