Subject: The salt pork is rotten

Captain,

A grim report from the galley, sir.

The last batch of salt pork, the one we tapped into yesterday, it's gone bad. Rotten through and through. The smell alone is enough to turn a man's stomach, and I've condemned the entire barrel. It's not fit for pig slop, let alone feeding the crew.

This puts us in a right pickle, Captain. That was meant to last us a good stretch, and now we're short on our primary provisions. We'll be relying heavily on hardtack and what fresh catch we can haul in, but that won't sustain a crew like ours for long.

We need a solution, and fast, before hunger starts breeding discontent in the ranks.
