Subject: Is the Captain going mad?

Maggie,

I need to ask you something, just between us.

Lately, the Captain... he seems to be losing his grip. His decisions are growing increasingly erratic, from the sudden change in course, to canceling shore leave, and then to outright challenging a Man-o'-War when all logic screamed otherwise. And now, the talk of his old leg acting up, which always seems to precede his more... 'inspired' commands.

He's been secretive, yes, but now it feels like more than just strategy. It's almost... irrational. You're close to him with the charts and the course. Have you noticed anything amiss? Does he seem... well, not himself?

I'm starting to worry he's steering us not just into dangerous waters, but into madness itself.

Anne.
