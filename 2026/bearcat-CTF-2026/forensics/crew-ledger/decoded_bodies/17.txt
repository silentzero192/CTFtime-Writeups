Subject: PHISHING ALERT: Don't click 'Free Rum'

Ahoy, Crew,

It has come to my attention that some of you have received emails with the subject line 'Free Rum' or similar promises of untold grog. Let me be clear: this is a trick!

**DO NOT CLICK ON ANY LINKS IN THESE EMAILS!**

These messages are not from me, nor are they from any legitimate source on board. Clicking the link will not get you free rum, but it will likely infect your devices with digital scurvy and compromise our systems.

If you receive an email like this, delete it immediately. If you have already clicked on such a link, report it to me at once.

Stay vigilant, and remember, there's no such thing as a free barrel of rum in your inbox.
