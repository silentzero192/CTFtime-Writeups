Captain,

With the battle behind us and the skies clearing, I've managed to re-establish our precise position.

We've drifted a bit off the planned route, as expected after such an engagement and without clear celestial markers, but I've laid in a new bearing. We are now back on course, making good speed towards our intended destination, or at least the nearest suitable port for repairs and resupply.

The *Scallywag* may be bruised, but she's still true.

Maggie.
