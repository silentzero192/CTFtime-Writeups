Captain,

The battle was fierce, and while we held our own, the *Scallywag* has taken a beating.

I've completed an initial assessment of the damages following the engagement. The attached `damage.docx` details the extent of the impact on our hull, rigging, and various compartments. Most critically, several gunports sustained direct hits, and the provisions hold has taken on some water, impacting a portion of our remaining fresh stores.

We'll need Stitch to assess the sails, and Barnaby's lads will be working overtime on the rigging and hull repairs. Supplies will be stretched thin for these fixes.

I'll be coordinating with the other officers to prioritize repairs and manage what remains of our resources. We are seaworthy, but not without significant effort.

Silas "The Shark" Vane
Quartermaster
