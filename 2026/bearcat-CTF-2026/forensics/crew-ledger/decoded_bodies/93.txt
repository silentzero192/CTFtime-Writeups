Captain,

Land ho!

Just as you predicted, sir, a faint outline has appeared on the horizon. Bearing dead ahead, slightly to starboard.

It matches the contours I've charted for our destination perfectly. The currents are with us, and the winds are holding steady. We'll be making for shore soon.

Maggie.
