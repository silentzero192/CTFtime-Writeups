Steve,

Bloody hell, that was a close one!

Thought I was a goner for sure when that last broadside hit near my station. But I made it! Just a few scrapes and bruises, nothing Pox can't ignore.

Glad to still be in one piece. We'll have to share a grog or ten to celebrate not being shark bait.

Thomas.
