Subject: Gunpowder inventory low

Captain,

A grim report from the powder magazine, sir. My recent audit shows our gunpowder stores are running dangerously low, far more than comfortable, especially with the uncertain waters ahead.

The attached `inventory.xlsx` details the current stock for all shot types – cannon, musket, and pistol – and I've highlighted the critical shortages. We're well under what I'd consider a safe reserve for any serious engagement or even sustained practice.

With a proper fight, we'd be blowing smoke and not much else after a few broadsides. This needs addressing with haste, Captain. My cannons are hungry, but they can't eat air.
