Subject: The Voyage Begins

Ahoy, me hearties!

The tide is turning, the wind is fair, and the horizon beckons. Our long-awaited voyage is finally upon us! Lay aside yer shore leave dreams, sharpen yer cutlasses, and ready yer stomachs for the rolling deep.

We sail at dawn. I expect every man and woman to be at their stations, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. This journey promises great riches and glorious adventure, but only for those who earn it.

Attached ye'll find a fresh copy of our standing Rules of Engagement. Read 'em, memorize 'em, and live by 'em, lest ye find yerselves answering to me personally. No excuses, no quarter. We work as one, we fight as one, and we plunder as one.

Let the rum flow tonight, for tomorrow, we chase destiny!

Captain "Black" Hook
