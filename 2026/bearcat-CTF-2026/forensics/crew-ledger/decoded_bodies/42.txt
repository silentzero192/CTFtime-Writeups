Subject: Found a weird key in the hold

Silas,

While continuing my inventory checks in the deepest part of the hold, near where those crates of gold *should* have been, I stumbled upon something unusual.

It's a strange key, unlike any I've seen on board before. Doesn't look like any of our standard lock keys, and it certainly wasn't in any of the usual places for forgotten items. It was almost hidden, tucked away behind some old rigging spares.

I've attached a picture of it (`key_photo.png`). Given the circumstances with the missing gold, I thought this might be worth bringing to your attention immediately.

Silver.
