Barnaby,

Thomas is in my quarters again, requiring my attention for another superficial but nonetheless irritating laceration to his hand. This makes the third such incident this week, each one preventable if the man would simply pay more heed to his surroundings – or perhaps exercise a modicum of caution with his "thieving."

He's patched up now, but I've warned him that my supply of clean bandages and even my patience are not infinite. Perhaps a reminder from the Boatswain regarding proper tool handling, or indeed, the handling of anything sharp on this vessel, might prevent another visit.

Just thought you should know.

Pox.
