Subject: Hint: Your first ship's name

Captain,

Regarding your query about the forgotten encryption password for your VeraCrypt volume:

I cannot directly recover or reset the password for an encrypted volume. By its very design, VeraCrypt is built to prevent such recovery to ensure maximum security. If the password is lost, the data within the container is, unfortunately, irrecoverable.

However, I can offer a hint based on some information you provided during the initial setup phrase:

Consider the name of your very first ship.

I hope this jogs your memory.
