Captain!

Trouble, sir!

I've just spotted a small rowboat being lowered from our port side, near the stern. There's a figure in it, pulling hard away from the ship, making for the shore! They're moving fast under the cover of the fading light.

It looks like someone's making a run for it, Captain!
