Subject: Mandatory Scurvy Check

Listen up, you mangy lot!

It's come to my attention that some of you have been looking a bit pale, and your gums... well, let's just say they're not looking as healthy as a fresh catch.

To avoid any widespread unpleasantness – and believe me, you do *not* want to experience the full delights of advanced scurvy – I am instituting a mandatory scurvy check for *all* crew members.

Report to the sickbay, or my usual makeshift clinic on the main deck if the weather holds, immediately after the midday meal, starting with the quarterdeck officers and working down. I'll call you by watch.

This is not a suggestion. This is an order. Anyone failing to report will be personally escorted by the bosun, and I assure you, my examination will be far less gentle. We'll get to the bottom of this, one way or another. Bring your mouths, bring your limbs, and if you've been hiding any suspicious spots, now's the time to confess.

Consider this for your own good, and the good of the ship.

Dr. Alistair Pox
Ship's Surgeon
