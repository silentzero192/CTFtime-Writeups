Captain,

Understood. The new course for Tortuga is plotted, aiming for arrival within the three-day window, accounting for the recent "peculiar patterns" I reported.

I've attached a *revised_map.pdf* with the proposed route highlighted and key waypoints marked. I've tried to factor in the unpredictable winds and currents as best I can for the most efficient and safe passage.

I'll be up to your cabin shortly with the charts for review, as you requested.

Maggie.
