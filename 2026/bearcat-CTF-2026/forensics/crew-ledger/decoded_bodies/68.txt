Silas,

Following your request regarding the retrieval of certain deleted files from the ship's server, I have completed the recovery process.

The data you inquired about has been successfully retrieved from the system backups. I have compiled and compressed these files into an archive.

You will find the recovered files attached as `recovered.zip`. Please ensure you handle these files securely and verify their contents.

Should you require any further assistance or have questions about the recovery process, do not hesitate to contact me.
