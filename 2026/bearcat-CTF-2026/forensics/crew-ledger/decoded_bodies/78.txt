Captain,

A matter of vital importance from the galley.

Our spice stores are almost completely depleted. After that last battle and the subsequent feast, what little remained has vanished like a ghost in the fog.

Without a fresh supply of pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and even simple salt, the food will be as bland as boiled shoe leather, and that won't do much for crew morale, especially after the last few days. A hungry crew is one thing; a *bored* crew is another entirely.

We need to acquire a new stock of spices at our next port of call. It's not just for taste, it's for keeping the spirits up.

Groggy George
