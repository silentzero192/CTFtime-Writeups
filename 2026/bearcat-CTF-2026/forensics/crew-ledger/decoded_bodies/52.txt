Subject: Repairing the Jolly Roger

Stitch,

The Jolly Roger took a bit of a beating in that last storm. Got a couple of significant rips, and the edges are fraying.

The Captain wants it flying proud and strong, especially with a bounty on his head. Can you get to it soon? It's important for morale, and for letting the world know who we are.

Let me know if you need any extra canvas or thread from the stores.

Barnaby.
