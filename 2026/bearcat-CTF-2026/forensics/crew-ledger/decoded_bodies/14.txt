Subject: Loot distribution for the last raid

Alright, you greedy lot!

The numbers are in, and the accounts are settled for our recent... acquisition. We took a good prize, and now it's time for every man and woman aboard to get their fair share, as per tradition and the Captain's decree.

Attached you'll find `shares.csv`, detailing each crew member's cut of the plunder. Don't go crying to me if you think you deserved more; the shares were calculated based on rank, participation, and a few other considerations I won't bore you with.

Distribution of the coin and goods will begin after the midday meal, on the main deck. Be there, be orderly, and be prepared to take your due. Any disputes will be heard *after* everyone has received their share, and only if you can present a solid argument.

And remember, what's yours is yours, and what's someone else's... well, let's keep it that way, shall we? I've got a keen eye for sticky fingers.

Silas "The Shark" Vane
Quartermaster
The Scallywag
