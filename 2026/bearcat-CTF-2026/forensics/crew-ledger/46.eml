Mr. Hands,

I'm really, really sorry, sir.

I was moving the powder from the small cask to the charges, just like you sho=
wed me, but I tripped over a loose rope. Some of the powder... well, it spill=
ed. Not a lot, I think, but enough to make a small cloud.

I tried to clean it up best I could, but I just wanted to let you know right =
away. I didn't mean to, honest.

Pete.
