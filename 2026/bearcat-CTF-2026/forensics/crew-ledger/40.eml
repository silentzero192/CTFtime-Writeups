Captain,

A matter of urgency regarding our combat readiness.

Following our recent skirmishes and considering the targets ahead, our stores=
 of cannonballs are critically depleted. We simply do not have enough shot to=
 sustain a prolonged engagement, or even a proper defense, should we encounte=
r a well-armed opponent.

My lads are ready, but without sufficient iron to load, our cannons are littl=
e more than expensive ornaments. This needs immediate attention, sir. We cann=
ot afford to be caught unawares with empty magazines.
