Maggie,

Considering your recent weather observations and some other... *developments*=
, I've decided we need to adjust our course.

Set a new bearing for Tortuga. We'll make for the main harbor. I want to be t=
here within the next three days, tide and wind willing. Calculate the most di=
rect and safest route.

Come to my cabin with the charts once you've plotted the new course. I want t=
o review it with you and discuss the potential challenges your "peculiar patt=
erns" might present.

Captain.
