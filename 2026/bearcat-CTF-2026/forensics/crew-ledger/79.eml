Silver,

I've just been down to the main treasure chest. It's empty. Completely bare.

This isn't just about the *missing* crates you reported earlier; this is abou=
t the entire consolidated haul. Everything. Gone.

I need an explanation, and I need it now. What in Davy Jones' locker happened=
? Where is it all?

Meet me in my quarters, immediately. Don't be late.

Silas.
