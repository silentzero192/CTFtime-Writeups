Stitch,

Me trousers have gone and ripped a proper hole, right in the backside. Must'v=
e caught it on somethin' sharp during the storm.

Can ye patch 'em up for me when you get a moment? It's me only decent pair, a=
nd I'd rather not be showin' me bare arse to the seagulls.

I'll bring 'em over to your work area when you're free.

Steve
