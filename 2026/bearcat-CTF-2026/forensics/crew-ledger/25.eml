Ahoy, Shipmates,

Just a heads-up on what's cookin' tonight in the galley.

After much toil and sweat, I've managed to whip up a batch of my famous Turtl=
e Soup. It'll be rich, hearty, and sure to put some warmth in yer bellies.

Don't be late for your mess call. First come, first served.

Groggy George.
