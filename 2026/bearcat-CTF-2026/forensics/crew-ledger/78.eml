Captain,

A matter of vital importance from the galley.

Our spice stores are almost completely depleted. After that last battle and t=
he subsequent feast, what little remained has vanished like a ghost in the fo=
g.

Without a fresh supply of pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and even simple salt, the f=
ood will be as bland as boiled shoe leather, and that won't do much for crew =
morale, especially after the last few days. A hungry crew is one thing; a *bo=
red* crew is another entirely.

We need to acquire a new stock of spices at our next port of call. It's not j=
ust for taste, it's for keeping the spirits up.

Groggy George
