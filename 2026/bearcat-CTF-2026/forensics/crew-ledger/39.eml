Captain,

Following your recent decree regarding the cancellation of shore leave, I mus=
t report that the mood among the crew has turned sour, and quickly.

There's a good deal of grumbling, outright complaints, and more than a few gl=
um faces. They were all looking forward to stretching their legs and enjoying=
 some time off in Tortuga, and this news has hit them hard.

I'm keeping a tight rein on things, but the discontent is palpable. It's maki=
ng the lads less eager for duty, and there's a definite edge to their usual b=
anter. Just wanted to make you aware of the situation on deck.

Barnaby.
