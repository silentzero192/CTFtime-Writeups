Silas,

Please be advised that I will be performing essential maintenance on the main=
 server tonight, commencing at midnight.

There will be a period of downtime, estimated to last approximately two hours=
, during which email services and any other networked systems will be unavail=
able. Please ensure any critical communications are sent before then.

I expect full functionality to be restored by 0200.

Admin
