Captain!

Trouble on the horizon, sir!

Bearing WNW, a good three leagues off, I've spotted a sail. Big one. Looks li=
ke a man-o'-war, flying British colours. She's moving fast, heading our way. =
No doubt she's on patrol, or worse, heard whispers of us.

This ain't no merchantman, Captain. This is a fight if we don't move swift.
