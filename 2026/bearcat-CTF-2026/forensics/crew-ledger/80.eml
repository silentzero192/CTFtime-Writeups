Silas,

With all due respect, when did I become the sole keeper of the main treasure =
chest key?

Last I checked, the primary key for the main chest was always with the Quarte=
rmaster. After I reported the *crates* missing, I assumed you would have take=
n extra precautions or, at the very least, would have been the one to secure =
the primary chest.

My duties are inventory and logistics, not standing guard over every last coi=
n, especially when the main key wasn't in my possession.

I'm as shocked as you are, perhaps more so given the earlier discovery of tha=
t *other* key. This is a far bigger problem than simple misplacement.

Silver.
