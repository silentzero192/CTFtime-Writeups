Silas,

Me hammock's seen better days, and after that last fight, it's ripped beyond =
mending. Caught a stray splinter from a damaged beam, I reckon.

It's not fit for sleep anymore, and me back's starting to feel every plank. C=
ould I put in a request for a new one from stores? A man needs his rest to pu=
ll his weight.

Let me know when one might be available.

Steve.
