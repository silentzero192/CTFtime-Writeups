Maggie,

I need to ask you something, just between us.

Lately, the Captain... he seems to be losing his grip. His decisions are grow=
ing increasingly erratic, from the sudden change in course, to canceling shor=
e leave, and then to outright challenging a Man-o'-War when all logic screame=
d otherwise. And now, the talk of his old leg acting up, which always seems t=
o precede his more... 'inspired' commands.

He's been secretive, yes, but now it feels like more than just strategy. It's=
 almost... irrational. You're close to him with the charts and the course. Ha=
ve you noticed anything amiss? Does he seem... well, not himself?

I'm starting to worry he's steering us not just into dangerous waters, but in=
to madness itself.

Anne.
