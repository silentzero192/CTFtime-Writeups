Ahoy, everyone!

Listen up! I've been watchin' the horizon, and there's a proper beast of a st=
orm headin' our way. Skies are turnin' dark faster than a stolen coin, and th=
e wind's starting to howl somethin' fierce from the north-west.

Looks like it'll be on us within the hour, maybe sooner. Brace yourselves and=
 secure everything on deck!

Jenkins.
