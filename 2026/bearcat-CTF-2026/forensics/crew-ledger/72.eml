Pox,

My accursed leg is acting up again. The old wound, you know the one. That las=
t broadside we took didn't help, jostled it something fierce.

It's giving me a real bite tonight, throbbing like a drum. I need something t=
o take the edge off, or at least to let me get some damn sleep before the nex=
t watch.

Send up whatever potion or poultice you deem fit. And make it quick.

Captain.
