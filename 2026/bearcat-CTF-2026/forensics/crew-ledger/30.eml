Alright, listen up, you lot!

Old Man Jenkins ain't wrong. We've got a proper squall on our hands, and it's=
 comin' fast.

**Batten down every hatch! Secure all loose gear on deck and below! Lash down=
 the cannons!** Get all sails furled tight, and make sure every rope is prope=
rly secured. Any man caught shirking his duties will answer to me directly.

Move swiftly and carefully. Let's make sure this ship rides out the storm.

Barnaby.
