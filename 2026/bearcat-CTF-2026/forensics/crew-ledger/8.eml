Captain,

A grim report from the galley, sir.

The last batch of salt pork, the one we tapped into yesterday, it's gone bad.=
 Rotten through and through. The smell alone is enough to turn a man's stomac=
h, and I've condemned the entire barrel. It's not fit for pig slop, let alone=
 feeding the crew.

This puts us in a right pickle, Captain. That was meant to last us a good str=
etch, and now we're short on our primary provisions. We'll be relying heavily=
 on hardtack and what fresh catch we can haul in, but that won't sustain a cr=
ew like ours for long.

We need a solution, and fast, before hunger starts breeding discontent in the=
 ranks.

Groggy George
Cook
